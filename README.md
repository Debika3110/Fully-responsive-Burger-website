# 🍔 Responsive Burger Website

A modern, fully responsive burger restaurant website built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project was created during my early exploration of Tailwind CSS to understand utility-first design principles, responsive layouts, and interactive front-end development.

## 📖 Project Description

This project simulates a real-world burger restaurant landing page with a clean layout, interactive navigation, and fully responsive design across all devices. It demonstrates how Tailwind CSS can simplify styling and accelerate front-end development with a utility-first approach.

The goal of this project was to:

- Practice building responsive UIs with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Learn how to structure components using utility classes.
- Understand basic JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., mobile navigation toggle).
- Create a mobile-first design that adapts to all screen sizes.
- Explore transitions, hover effects, and layout responsiveness.

Although simple, this burger website is a solid example of how powerful Tailwind CSS can be for modern web development, even without a build process or framework.
